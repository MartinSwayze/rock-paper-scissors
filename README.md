# rock-paper-scissors
This is another assignment from The Odin Project. It is introduction task for Javascript, where I created set of functions imitating game Rock Paper Scissors. Whole game is 'played' in console where each round computer makes random pick (rock, paper, scissor) and player has choice to write his move. After the input choices are evaluated and result is written in console with incremented score. Game is played for 5 rounds.
